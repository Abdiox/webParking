# Welcome to the AM Parking App Repository
This repository contains a functional guest parking web app.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js
  
### Setup (If the backend is running as PaaS):
### 1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Abdiox/webParking.git
```
### 2. Install the necessary dependencies:
```
cd webParking
npm install
```
### 3. Start the application:
```
npm run dev
```

Once the app is built, you should be able to create your own user and you're good to go!
If the backend is no longer running as PaaS, you will need to set it up yourself.
